     * each scheme's specification may further restrict the syntax and
     * semantics of identifiers using that scheme.
     *
     * Scheme names consist of a sequence of characters beginning with a
     * letter and followed by any combination of letters, digits, plus
     * ("+"), period ("."), or hyphen ("-"). Although schemes are case-
     * insensitive, the canonical form is lowercase and documents that
     * specify schemes must do so with lowercase letters. An implementation
     * should accept uppercase letters as equivalent to lowercase in scheme
     * names (e.g., allow "HTTP" as well as "http") for the sake of
     * robustness but should only produce lowercase scheme names for
     * consistency.
